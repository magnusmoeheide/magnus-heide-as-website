# Business Card Website Template

I create this website to function like a business card would. It's meant to be used as a static website where you can display basic information like your name, company, logo, and contact links. Card size and shape changed depending on what size screen the website is being visited from. This is a very small and easy to edit website so feel free to use this code for yourself.

You can checkout the code in action [here](https://avigael.github.io/business-card-site/ "demo").
